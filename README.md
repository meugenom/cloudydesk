### Web Desktop (Under construction)

Hey! 

I want to be able to create a prototype of a small web desktop written on javascript with angular and java on the backend side. It's a gut idea to have functional applications like a terminal app, draw app, text editor, photo viewer, and media player onboard. Maybe it would be with primitive functionality.
I will be glad and pleased to listen to some critiques about my code or ideas. Helping is welcome.

Best Regards!
