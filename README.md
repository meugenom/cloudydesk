#### **About**
Neetcloud App is in a progressive state.
NeetCloud is an app for the web. You can use the demo app at neetcloud.dev. Itâ€™s a dynamic site with a database MongoDB on board. The main goal of this website is to make a useful and friendly cloud like a desktop manager, which is a little bit similar to shell OS. So we plan to have our small functional embedded applications like a terminal app, draw app, text editor, photo viewer, media player, etc. It would be workable with simple functionality.
NeetCloud App is Open Source App. You can download the code and make your changes.

NeetCloud App was created with TypeScript, Angular, Ng Redux, Java, Spring Framework, and MongoDB-community. Please see:

- Code:
  - [client code in progress](./client/)
  - [server code in progress](/server/)

- Info:
  - [client readme](./client/README.md)
  - [server readme](./server/README.md)

I'll be glad and pleased to listen to some critiques about the code or ideas. **Helping is welcome**.
