#### Hello! 

I want to create an open source prototype of a small web desktop written on javascript (angular) on frontend and java on the backend. It's a wonderful to have functional applications like a terminal app, draw app, text editor, photo viewer, and media player onboard. It would be workable with simple functionality.
I'll be glad and pleased to listen to some critiques about my code or ideas. **Helping is welcome**.

### **What do we have just now?** 

A little bit, but still:
- animated web view with space background, taskbar, and app icons
- capable desktop's full-window mode
- modals start from taskbar icons:
	- closing, maximize, minimize, moving window-app / back to small window-app
	- make window-app active with click when we have other opened window-apps
	- resizing window-app by left-bottom icon
- in app terminal ability to input commands, "clear" for example, others in progress
- selection files on the desktop and in Finder and change places between (drag and drop)
- context-menu (only visually)
